        <h1>WHAT IS CARBON FOOTPRINT?</h1>
        <p>A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO₂), emitted directly or indirectly by an 
        individual, organization, event, or product. It is measured in terms of CO₂-equivalent emissions and results from activities like 
        transportation, energy consumption, manufacturing, and food production. The larger the carbon footprint, the greater the contribution 
        to global warming and climate change. Reducing carbon footprints can be achieved through energy efficiency, using renewable energy, 
        minimizing waste, and adopting sustainable lifestyle choices such as using public transport, consuming less meat, and supporting eco
        -friendly products.</p>

        <h2>What types of carbon footprints are there?</h2>
        <p>Depending on the activity we're analyzing, distinct types of carbon footprint can be identified, considering the activity's typical 
        GHG emissions per year.</p>

        <h3>Individual carbon footprint</h3>
        <p>It's based on the consumption habits of the person and takes into account GHG emissions associated with their means of transportation, 
        electricity use for heating and cooling at home, eating habits, consumption of goods, recycling habits, etc.</p>

        <h3>Product footprint</h3>
        <p>This includes the GHG emissions from the stages of raw material extraction, production process, required energy generation, product 
        transformation for other companies, the customer's usage, and its treatment as waste as well as the transportation between stages.</p>

        <h3>Corporate footprint</h3>
        <p>It includes the GHG emissions inventory related to a company or organization's operations. It's the main basis for identifying energy 
        efficiency measures within the organization as well as joint action measures with other companies in the sector.</p>
