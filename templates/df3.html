        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW TO REDUCE CARBON FOOTPRINT?</h1>
        <p>Without a doubt, responsible consumption is one our greatest allies, but there's even more we can do to try to cut our carbon footprint. 
        Here are a few tips we can put into practice in our day-to-day lives to reduce it:</p>
       
        <h4>Consume local seasonal products</h4>
        <p>By consuming proximity or zero-mile products, we help reduce the CO2 emissions derived from the refrigeration or transportation of food 
        products. What's more, we're contributing to boosting the local economy. It's all benefits!</p>

        <h4>Use high energy efficiency appliances</h4>
        <p>Next-generation appliances are increasingly more sustainable and efficient. Also, checking the labeling of the appliance you're going to 
        buy is essential to know if they're made following sustainability standards throughout the value chain. Go to our page on energy efficiency to get in the know.</p>
        <h4>Use water and electricity efficiently</h4>

        <p>We can try to save energy at home by unplugging any electronic devices we're not using. Also, if we maintain the temperature between 18ºC 
        and 23ºC, we'll save on heating. Similarly, we should make the most of natural light during the day to save on our power bill.We can also 
        save hundreds of liters of water by turning off the tap while soaping up or brushing our teeth.</p>

        <h4>Use sustainable transportation whenever possible</h4>
        <p>Using public transportation or other solutions such as bicycles or electric scooters contributes to reducing the carbon footprint, while 
        improving mobility in cities and raising the citizens' quality of life index.Also, other sustainable mobility alternatives, such as carsharing
        , help reduce traffic congestion and save on private vehicle maintenance costs.</p>

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" >Measures companies can adopt to reduce their carbon footprint</h2>
        <P>Companies and organizations can also implement measures aimed at cutting their carbon footprint by always giving priority to actions that 
        have a greater impact and introducing guidelines that create a carbon footprint reduction culture, both in their daily operations as well as 
        in the management of the product life cycle.</P>

        <h4>Promoting energy efficiency in all areas</h4>
        <p>Optimizing production processes and operational excellence not only involves a better use of energy and a resulting reduction in emissions, 
        it also leads to a better maintenance of equipment, fewer breakdowns, and improved safety.</p>

        <h4>Leveraging renewable energy sources</h4>
        <p>Nowadays, the evolution of the energy mix enables companies to implement different types of renewable energy into their management and 
        processes. There is a wide array of renewable energy sources to choose from based on individual needs, location, and demand.</p>

        <h4>Promoting the circular economy and applying its principles</h4>
        <p>The circular economy has a wide range of benefits. It protects the environment, reduces CO2 emissions, and minimizes the consumption of 
        natural resources. It benefits the local economy by promoting production models based, for example, on reverse logistics or reusing waste. 
        It also creates jobs and stimulates the development of a more innovative and competitive industrial model.</p>
