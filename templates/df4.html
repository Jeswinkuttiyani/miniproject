        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">WHAT ARE CARBON CREDITS?</h1>
        <p>A carbon credit is a permit that allows an entity (such as a company or country) to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gases, 
        typically one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or its equivalent. It is part of a system designed to limit, reduce, and offset 
        carbon emissions to combat climate change. Organizations can buy, sell, or trade these credits in carbon markets.</p>
        
        <h3>How Carbon Credits Work</h3>
        <p>Carbon credits operate within a cap-and-trade system or voluntary carbon markets. Here's how they function:</p>
        
        <h4>1. Setting an Emission Limit (Cap)</h4>
        <p>Governments or regulatory bodies set a limit on how much CO₂ a company, industry, or country can emit. 
        This is known as the carbon cap.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Allocating or Purchasing Carbon Credits</h4>
        <p>If a company emits less CO₂ than its allocated limit, it earns extra carbon credits. If a company emits more than its limit, 
        it must buy carbon credits from others to offset its excess emissions.</p>
        
        <h4>3. Trading Carbon Credits</h4>
        <p>Companies that have unused carbon credits can sell them to companies that need more credits. This creates a carbon market where 
        organizations trade credits based on supply and demand.</p>
        
        <h4>4. Carbon Offsetting</h4>
        <p>Companies or individuals can also purchase carbon credits to fund environmental projects that reduce CO₂, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reforestation (planting trees)</li>
            <li>Renewable energy projects (solar, wind)</li>
            <li>Methane capture projects (from landfills or agriculture)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By investing in these projects, emissions are offset, balancing out the carbon footprint.</p>
        
        <h3>Example of Carbon Credit Usage</h3>
        <p>A company is allowed to emit 1,000 tons of CO₂ per year but ends up emitting 1,200 tons. It can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy 200 carbon credits from another company that emitted less than its cap.</li>
            <li>Invest in a carbon offset project that removes 200 tons of CO₂ from the atmosphere.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Benefits of Carbon Credits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✔ Encourages companies to reduce emissions</li>
            <li>✔ Promotes investment in green energy and sustainability projects</li>
            <li>✔ Provides a financial incentive for businesses to be more eco-friendly</li>
            <li>✔ Helps countries meet international climate targets like the Paris Agreement</li>
        </ul>
